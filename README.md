# AI Agent Project

This repository contains an AI Agent designed to interact with a codebase using a set of predefined tools. The agent leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand user requests, plan actions, execute code-related tasks, and provide intelligent responses.

# Intended Use

The primary purpose of this AI Agent is to demonstrate and explore agentic behavior in a programming context. It is capable of:Code Analysis: Reading and understanding the content of various files within the project.Debugging: Identifying and autonomously fixing bugs by modifying code files.Code Execution: Running Python scripts and capturing their output.File Management: Listing files and directories, and creating or updating files.Automated Workflow: Iterating through a series of actions (tool calls) to achieve complex goals, such as finding information or resolving issues within the codebase.This project serves as a foundation for building more sophisticated AI-driven development tools and illustrates the power of combining LLM reasoning with external function execution.

# Credits

This project was developed as part of a Boot.dev assignment. Special thanks to Boot.dev for providing the comprehensive project structure, challenging assignments, and the robust CLI testing environment that facilitated the development and verification of this AI Agent.
